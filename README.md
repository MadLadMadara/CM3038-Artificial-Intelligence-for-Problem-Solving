# CM3038-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Problem-Solving
The Program The requirements: • Your program must be written in Java. ◦ It must implement the A* search algorithm. ◦ It takes an initial state and a goal state as input parameters. ◦ It finds and prints the solution with the lowest cost, or “no solution” if it cannot be found. ◦ Your solution MUST use the given cm3038.search and cm3038.search.informed libraries.1  A solution that does not use the given libraries will not be accepted. • For the basic problem, you can assume the followings: ◦ There are always 4 people. ◦ The boat has exactly 2 seats. ◦ However, your highest grade is confined to a B if your program can only solve the basic problem. • For the general/advanced problem: ◦ The number of people is flexible but must be >0. ◦ The number of seats in the boat is flexible but must be >=2. ◦ Your program must be able to solve the general problem if you want to achieve an A grade. • In both basic and advanced problems, the following parameters are configurable: ◦ A person’s ability to sail the boat. ◦ Each person’s weight. ◦ The maximum load of the boat.
